MiniMA is a small-scaled design of computer architecture, built using SystemVerilog and Python, that adapts the original
load-store and accumulator machines with a change in the number of bits using, 9-bit machine code. The intention of
this design is to prioritize simplicity in memory while able to ensure time efficiency. 

This is a coursework project and has been continued of maintaining and debug since. Project partner: [Thu Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thu-mai-237992259/)
